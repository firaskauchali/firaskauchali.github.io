The objective was to ensure the booklet reinforces the expression of the architect by referencing the elements found in Erickson’s work.</p>

I decided to stick within that family, and utilize various weights and sizes to create hierarchy. I don’t think it gets more brutal than Akzidenz Grotesk Super.</p>

I got the character styles down pretty easily, but nailing the layout for each spread took an extensive amount of exploration and refinement.</p>

Printing his name by molding it with the landscape it sits on—or in this case, the paper—is, in my opinon, an excellent way to commemorate his life’s work. However, there was one big issue with this process. It was unreasonably expensive to have a custom design embossed professionally for the amount of copies I was printing</p>

I refined the typography by tweaking a few characters so they aligned with each other harmoniously. When I was happy with the design, I laser cut the characters and created a plate with some cheap illustration board. I chose Stonehenge Paper in Steel Grey to mimic concrete and began testing my handcrafted plate with basic ceramic tools and some elbow grease, and this is what I got  &hellip;</p>

They’re so unusual; they can’t be understood in a literal sense, but we pick them up so naturally and they metaphorically paint a picture that can only be interpreted by people who speak the same language or share the same culture. So I made a long list of all the idioms I could think of and tried coming up with clever concepts to communicate them through found typography.</p>

Even though I’m only displaying the first two words of the phrase, the visual cues were more than enough to communicate what I am getting at. Hinting at the phrase allows the audience to have an interactive expierence with the piece. It creates the “aha!” moment which we all love—the same one you probably had earlier on as you looked through this project.</p>

As I was creating the piece I thought, “It definitely would have been much easier to use white school glue and a brush,” but that wouldn’t be fair—it would lose its integrity. As you can see, the first attempt was a disaster.</p>

The most difficult aspect was making sure my aesthetic choices were synonymous with the message being conveyed. To accomplish this, I switched the red background to a dark wooden surface, creating a more dramatic scene. I also inversed and cleaned up the typography. The type was influenced by the letter forms plastered on the walls of The Korova Milk Bar from the film, A Clockwork Orange.</p>

They are these incredibly sweet, fried desserts that usually contain sugar, milk, or condensed milk as base ingredients. The rest of the ingredients vary according to the palette of that specific region. Mithai are commonly shared during festivals such as Holi, Diwali, Eid, and Raksha Bhandan. Although mithai are a rich part of Indian culture, I haven’t seen that translate well into the North American market.</p>

I realized that a lot of effort goes into the product, the mithai themselves, and not the brand. Mithai are usually found at small bakeries or street vendors. They go by the pound and are usually packaged in paper bags or boxes. In a country with thousands of flavours, every sweet vendor adds a slightly different taste to make their product stand out. There isn’t much effort put into the presentation or brand experience—these luxuries just don’t matter to the customer, who are usually just locals of the area.</p>

By looking at the differences, I’ve created an experience that is suitable for both the Indian community—who are familiar with the product—and the unfamiliar faces who will be trying mithai for the first time. Since we’re marketing for both parties, it is important that we sustain enough of India’s culture while slightly tweaking areas in order to appeal to the western market.</p>
                                            <p class="column">The solution was to simply combine some of the heavily cultured aspects of India and incorporate that into the brand. “Dabbah Wallah” roots from the Hindi title of a lunch box delivery worker.

                                            <p class="medium-10 column">Tiffin boxes are very common in India as most people prefer to eat home cooked meals over fast food. The tiffin box has multiple compartments so that the user can carry different dishes while keeping them separated. It’s very uncommon for a customer to purchase just one box of mithai since they’re usually shared with family and friends. By putting the two together, I translated the tiffin box into the packaging for Dabbah Wallah to satisfy the needs of the customer while also enhancing the cultural aspect of the brand.</p>

A common decorational art, known as Rangoli, can be seen everywhere during any of the festivals held in India. The pattern is formed and repeated in a circular path to create an intricate design. Made from a variety of coloured powder, Rangoli patterns are very vibrant. All of these elements were taken into consideration when developing the visual identity of the brand. In order to satisfy the rest of our audience, the patterns have been simplified and the colour scheme includes a more diverse set of hues. </p>

The campaign deliverables have to be bilingual and specific to the city of Toronto. The focus isn’t to change behaviours that impact environment, but to create a community discussion, involvement, and resiliency to reduce vunerability in the event of a weather emergency. The goal here is to strengthen our immediate communitites.</p>

I chose to create a system for a series of posters comparing emergency preparedness to the simple tasks we perform on a regular basis in order to avoid common difficulties. The advertisment is intially absorbed with a sense of humour in order to capture the audience, and then relays a hard hitting message which will hopefully resonate with them.</p>

They stroll the city in order to experience the dynamics of the cty from a disengaged point of view. Another aesthetically attuned observer is the street photographer. All photographs showcased throughout the magazine are captured through black &amp; white analog photography, with little to no re-touching. This beta issue will be featuring the city of Toronto.</p>
