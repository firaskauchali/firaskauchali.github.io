He gained popularity for his ability to mold structures to their natural landscapes in both urban, and rural environments.</p>

The objective was to ensure the booklet reinforces the expression of the architect by referencing the elements found in Erickson’s work.</p>

I decided to stick within that family, and utilize various weights and sizes to create hierarchy. I don’t think it gets more brutal than Akzidenz Grotesk Super.</p>

I decided to limit myself to just two of Erickson’s buildings that I believe represent his gift of being able to juxtapose concrete with nature.</p>
                            <p class="medium-12 column end">I knew, in order to truly display Erickson’s work, I would need to capture the unapologetic strength of brutalism while also paying close attention to balancing the relationships and space between each element on the spread. I got the character styles down pretty easily, but nailing the layout for each spread took an extensive amount of exploration and refinement.</p>

                            <p class="medium-10 large-8 column">I came up with the idea of having Erickson’s name embossed on the cover midway through the project. Printing his name by molding it with the landscape it sits on—or in this case, the paper—is, in my opinon, an excellent way to commemorate his life’s work. However, there was one big issue with this process. It was unreasonably expensive to have a custom design embossed professionally for the amount of copies I was printing</p>

                            <p class="medium-12 column">I was so settled on this idea that I decided to give it a try myself, using the tools and materials I had access to. I refined the typography by tweaking a few characters so they aligned with each other harmoniously. When I was happy with the design, I laser cut the characters and created a plate with some cheap illustration board. I chose Stonehenge Paper in Steel Grey to mimic concrete and began testing my handcrafted plate with basic ceramic tools and some elbow grease, and this is what I got  &hellip;</p>

Before completely scrapping the idea, I ran the plate through an etching press using the same technique one would when making an intaglio print (without the ink) and voila! It came out a lot better than I could have hoped for.</p>
