I conceptualized the visual identity, product and packaging design for this brand as my final project for Package Design. The objective was to create a product that communicates effectively with two very different cultures. The modular packaging is constructed by precisely cutting cardstock without the use of adhesives.</p>

                        <p class="medium-12 large-10 large-offset-2 column ">Mithai, or Indian sweets, are a huge part of India’s culture. They are these incredibly sweet, fried desserts that usually contain sugar, milk, or condensed milk as base ingredients. The rest of the ingredients vary according to the palette of that specific region. Mithai are commonly shared during festivals such as Holi, Diwali, Eid, and Raksha Bhandan. Although mithai are a rich part of Indian culture, I haven’t seen that translate well into the North American market.</p>

                <div class="row">
                    <p class="medium-5 medium-push-7 large-4 large-push-8 column">I began by researching how sweets are made, presented, and sold in India. I realized that a lot of effort goes into the product, the mithai themselves, and not the brand. Mithai are usually found at small bakeries or street vendors. They go by the pound and are usually packaged in paper bags or boxes. In a country with thousands of flavours, every sweet vendor adds a slightly different taste to make their product stand out. There isn’t much effort put into the presentation or brand experience—these luxuries just don’t matter to the customer, who are usually just locals of the area.</p>

                            <p class="no-space column">In North America, we have a completely different sense of consumer culture. By looking at the differences, I’ve created an experience that is suitable for both the Indian community—who are familiar with the product—and the unfamiliar faces who will be trying mithai for the first time. Since we’re marketing for both parties, it is important that we sustain enough of India’s culture while slightly tweaking areas in order to appeal to the western market.</p>
                            <p class="column">The solution was to simply combine some of the heavily cultured aspects of India and incorporate that into the brand. “Dabbah Wallah” roots from the Hindi title of a lunch box delivery worker. The workers regularly deliver hot lunches in tiffin boxes (lunch boxes) to their clients. I took the concept and visual form of the tiffin box and implemented it into the brand’s visual language.</p>

                            <p class="medium-10 column">Tiffin boxes are very common in India as most people prefer to eat home cooked meals over fast food. The tiffin box has multiple compartments so that the user can carry different dishes while keeping them separated. It’s very uncommon for a customer to purchase just one box of mithai since they’re usually shared with family and friends. By putting the two together, I translated the tiffin box into the packaging for Dabbah Wallah to satisfy the needs of the customer while also enhancing the cultural aspect of the brand.</p>

                            <p class="medium-10 large-8 column">The hexagonal shape of the box, the patterns, colours, and overall visual design is inspired from India’s folk art. A common decorational art, known as Rangoli, can be seen everywhere during any of the festivals held in India. The pattern is formed and repeated in a circular path to create an intricate design. Made from a variety of coloured powder, Rangoli patterns are very vibrant. All of these elements were taken into consideration when developing the visual identity of the brand. In order to satisfy the rest of our audience, the patterns have been simplified and the colour scheme includes a more diverse set of hues. </p>
