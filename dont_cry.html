                    <p class="medium-5 medium-push-5 large-4 large-pull-8 column end">The objective for this project was to explore methods of creating typography by using found or constructed materials that can be found in our everyday environment. It was fairly simply—we were to choose a word or phrase and draw it out using objects that visually represent what we’re trying to communicate.</p>

                <div class="row">
                    <p class="medium-5 medium-push-7 large-4 column">During the same time I was coming up with concepts for this project, I was—for some odd reason—intrigued by our use of idioms. They’re so unusual; they can’t be understood in a literal sense, but we pick them up so naturally and they metaphorically paint a picture that can only be interpreted by people who speak the same language or share the same culture. So I made a long list of all the idioms I could think of and tried coming up with clever concepts to communicate them through found typography.</p>

                        <div class="row">
                            <p class="medium-12 column">The idiom, “Don't cry over spilled milk,” resonates with me and I believe it was the strongest concept that I had thought of for this project. Even though I’m only displaying the first two words of the phrase, the visual cues were more than enough to communicate what I am getting at. Hinting at the phrase allows the audience to have an interactive experience with the piece. It creates the “aha!” moment which we all love—the same one you probably had earlier on as you looked through this project.</p>

                <div class="row">
                    <p class="medium-5 medium-push-5 large-4 large-push-7 column">To create the typographic piece itself, I limited myself to only use a glass of 2% milk and a couple straws. As I was creating the piece I thought, “It definitely would have been much easier to use white school glue and a brush,” but that wouldn’t be fair—it would lose its integrity. As you can see, the first attempt was a disaster.</p>

                <div class="row">
                    <p class="medium-5 medium-offset-2 large-4 large-offset-3 column">I knew there was no point in crying over spilled milk so I just cleaned up and gave it another shot. It seemed to be working well this time, but I wasn’t exactly satisfied with the direction, especially the letter forms.</p>
                    <img class="medium-10 medium-offset-2 large-7 large-offset-5 column end" src="img/DC_process_attempt-2.jpg" alt="Second attempt">

                <div class="row">
                    <p class="medium-5 medium-push-5 large-4 column">Finding an appropriate art direction was tough. The most difficult aspect was making sure my aesthetic choices were synonymous with the message being conveyed. To accomplish this, I switched the red background to a dark wooden surface, creating a more dramatic scene. I also inversed and cleaned up the typography. The type was influenced by the letter forms plastered on the walls of The Korova Milk Bar from the film, A Clockwork Orange.</p>
